        <p>Growing up in the two-thousands meant being connected with technology everyday. Thus beginning an inseparable bond between my curiosity and computer systemsâ€™ development. During my highschool years, I started taking apart computers to learn what was inside and how they operated, but that quickly evolved to the brain of the machine and it never ended.</p>
        <p>In College, I studied software development and Object-Oriented programming then full stack web development which intertwined concepts of designing interactive websites and applications and servers with intergraded databases that managed necessary resources.</p> 
        <p>I have a firm belief that anyone can do anything with the proper passion to pursue strict and ambitious goals to complete the task at hand, and it's never a bad thing to ask for help from others. </p>
